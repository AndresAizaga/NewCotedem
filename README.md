React Login -> Hello World demo

How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with...).
2. Enter a username and click Submit.
3. You'll be redirected to the Hello World page. Click "Log out" to return to the Login page.

Notes

- This is a tiny demo using React via CDN and Babel for on-the-fly JSX transpilation. It's suitable for local demos and learning, not for production.
- If you want a production-ready app, I can scaffold a Create React App / Vite project instead.
